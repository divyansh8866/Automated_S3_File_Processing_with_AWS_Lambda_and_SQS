# Automated_S3_File_Processing_with_AWS_Lambda_and_SQS
This project demonstrates a serverless architecture for processing files uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket using AWS Lambda and Amazon SQS. The architecture ensures that when a user uploads a file to the S3 bucket, it triggers an event to SQS, which acts as a buffer for high volume data.
